    "text": "R (or RStudio) is a statistical programming package that allows users to carry out a wide range of statistical analyses. It can also function as GIS software, enabling various types of analysis on geographical data. In the same way, it can be used for data management and geoprocessing—for example, importing different types of data, whether non-spatial or spatial, and preparing them for analysis.\nThere are two versions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe famous icon on the left is the version for R (Base), and the one on the right is the version for RStudio. Both software packages are the same. The only difference is that RStudio is attractive, intuitive, and more importantly, it is user-friendly than Base R. So, we will be using this version (i.e., RStudio) throughout this workshop.\nLet us talk about the installation of RStudio on your personal computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Watch on YouTube]\nRStudio is an open-source software, it is free.

    "text": "The learning objectives for today are:\n\nBecome familiar with the user interface in RStudio\nPractice basic coding in the R Console\nOpen an R script and create basic objects in RStudio\nUnderstand different data types\nData entry and variable creation in RStudio\n\nThese objectives serve as a gateway to learning RStudio and building a strong foundation. Let us begin!\n\n\n\n\nWhen you open RStudio for the first time, you are greeted by its interface. The window is divided into three panels:\n\nR Console\nEnvironment\nFiles, Help, and Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel 1: The R Console allows you to type R code to perform quick commands and basic calculations. It also reports whether code executions from scripts are successful or have failed.\nPanel 2: The Environment shows the objects currently stored in RStudio’s memory, such as values, vectors, data frames, and spatial objects.\nPanel 3: This panel contains several tabs. The most important are: (i) Files: access folders on your computer to open datasets; (ii) Help: view help documentation for functions and commands; and (iii) Plots: review the plots you generate (e.g., histograms, scatterplots, maps).\n\nThe section at the top of RStudio is the Menu Bar. From here, you can access functions for saving, editing, and opening a new Script File. Opening a new Script File reveals a fourth panel above the Console.\nYou can open a Script File by:\n\nClicking on the File tab in the Menu Bar. A drop-down menu will appear. Scroll to New File. Under New File, click R Script. This opens a new script titled Untitled 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThroughout the course, and in all practical tutorials, you will be encouraged to use an R Script to collate and save the code you write for any statistical or spatial analysis. However, we will only begin working with scripts in section 1.4 of the tutorials. For now, let’s start with the absolute basics: interacting with the R Console and using it as a simple calculator for typing basic code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R Console window (Panel 1) is where RStudio waits for you to tell it what to do. It displays the code you enter and the results of each command. You can type commands directly into this window for immediate execution.\nLet’s begin by using the Console as a basic calculator for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponents (^), and other calculations.\nClick inside the R Console window, type 19+8, and press the Enter key (↵) to see the result. Then try the following calculations by typing them into the Console:\n\n# Perform addition\n19+8\n\n# Perform subtraction\n20-89\n\n# Perform multiplication\n18*20\n\n# Perform division\n27/3\n\n# To number to a power e.g., 2 raise to the power of 8\n2^8\n\n# Perform complex sums\n(5*(170-3.405)/91)+1002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe text that follows a hash symbol # in the code chunk is a comment, not actual code. It explains what the line of code without the # is doing.\n\n\nIn addition to basic arithmetic operations, we can also use common mathematical functions such as exponentials and logarithms:\n\nexp() calculates the exponential\nlog() calculates the logarithm\n\nDo not worry about fully understanding these functions for now as you will likely use them later in Weeks 8 and 9 when transforming variables.\nTry the following by typing them into the R Console window:\n\n# use exp() to apply an exponential to a value\nexp(5) \n\n# use log() to transforrm a value on to a logarithm scale\nlog(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s open an R Script file!\nNow that we are familiar with using the Console as a calculator, let’s build on this and learn one of the most important features in R: the Assignment Operator.\nThe arrow symbol &lt;- is called the Assignment Operator. You type it by pressing the less-than symbol &lt; followed by the hyphen -. It allows you to assign values to an object in R.\nObjects are stored quantities in RStudio’s environment. They can hold anything from numeric values to character strings. For example, to create a numeric object called x and assign it the value 3, type: x &lt;- 3. When you enter x in the Console and press Enter (↵), R will return the numeric value 3.\nSimilarly, to create a string object called y and assign it the text \"Hello!\", type: y &lt;- \"Hello!\" When you enter y in the Console, it will return the text value Hello!.\nNow, let’s create the objects a, b, c, and d and assign them numeric values. Perform the following by typing them into the R Console:\n\n# Create an object called 'a' and assign the value 17 to it\na &lt;- 17\n\n# Type the object 'a' in console as a command to return value 17\na\n\n# Create an object called 'b' and assign the value 10 to it\nb &lt;- 10\n\n# Type the object 'b' in console as a command to return value 10\nb\n\n# Create an object called 'c' and assign the value 9 to it\nc &lt;- 9\n\n# Type the object 'c' in console as a command to return value 9\nc\n\n# Create an object called 'd' and assign the value 8 to it\nd &lt;- 8\n\n# Type the object 'd' in console as a command to return value 8\nd\n\nNotice how the objects a, b, c and d and its value are listed and stored in RStudio’s environment panel. We can perform the following maths operations with these object values:\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(a + b + c + d)/5\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(5*(a-c)/d)^2\n\nLet us create more objects but this time we will assign character string(s) to them. Please note that when typing a string of characters as data you will need to cover them with quotation marks \"...\". For example, say we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this by typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\".\nTry these examples of assigning the following character text to an object:\nLet’s create more objects, but this time we will assign character strings to them. When typing a string of characters as data, you must enclose them in quotation marks \"...\".\nFor example, to create a string object called y and assign it the text \"Hello!\", type: y &lt;- \"Hello!\"\nTry the following examples to assign character text to objects:\n\n# Create an object called 'e' and assign the character string \"RStudio\"\ne &lt;- \"RStudio\"\n\n# Type the object 'e' in the console as a command to return \"RStudio\"\ne\n\n# Create an object called 'f', assign character string \"Hello world\" \nf &lt;- \"Hello world\"\n\n# Type the object 'f' in the console as a command to return \"Hello world\"\nf\n\n# Create an object called 'g' and assign \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\ng &lt;- \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\n\n# Type the object 'g' in the console to return the result\ng\n\n\n\n\n\nIn programming, variables are used to store information, and each has a type determined by the kind of data it holds (e.g., integer, character, factor, logical). Assigning an integer makes the variable type “int.” A variable is simply a reserved memory location where values are stored.\nTo use R effectively, you need a solid understanding of its basic data types, data structures, and how to work with them.\nR has a range of data types. The most common ones are:\n\nnumeric (whole, real or decimal)\nlogical\ncharacter\nfactor\n\nBelow are some basic examples of data points that are classed as character, numeric, or integer values, etc.\n\ncharacter: “a”, “swc”\nnumeric: 2.0, 15.5\nlogical: TRUE, FALSE\nfactor: 2 levels “boy”, “girl” (text categories with assigned numbers as a label)\n\nYou can use the class function i.e., class() on any object to identify its data type. For example, using the class() function on existing objects we created early on (i.e., e and f) in section 1.4 tells us that its a character object.\n\ne &lt;- \"RStudio\"\nf &lt;- \"Hello world\"\n\n\nclass(f)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(e)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nAnother example, using the class() function on existing objects we created early on (i.e., a and b) in section 1.4 tells us that its a numeric object.\n\na &lt;- 17\nb &lt;- 10\n\n\nclass(a)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(b)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nWe are now familiar with using the console and assigning numeric and string to objects, and identifying their data type. Let’s learn who to enter data into RStudio and create our first data frame.\n\n\n\n\nHere, we will learn some basics coding etiquettes creating a dataset from scratch using the two functions:\n\nc() combine function\ndata.frame(): data frame function\n\nAs you have already seen, RStudio is an object-oriented software package and so entering data is slightly different from the usual way of inputting information into a spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Here, you will need to enter the information as a Vector object before combining them into a Data Frame object.\nConsider this crude example of data containing the additional health information for 4 people. It contains the variable (or column) names id, name, height, weight and gender.\n\n\n\nid\nname\nheight\nweight\ngender\n\n\n\n\n1\nKofi\n1.65\n64.2\nM\n\n\n2\nHarry\n1.77\n80.3\nM\n\n\n3\nHuijun\n1.70\n58.7\nF\n\n\n4\nFatima\n1.68\n75.0\nF\n\n\n\nNow, when entering data to RStudio it is not like Microsoft Excel where we enter data into the cells of a spreadsheet. In RStudio, data is entered as a sequence of elements and listed inside an object called a vector.\nFor instance, if we have three age values of 12, 57 and 26 years, and we want to enter this in RStudio in that order, we need to use the combine function c() and combine these three elements into a vector object. Hence, the code will be c(12, 57, 26). We can assign this data by typing this code as age &lt;- c(12, 57, 26). Any time you type age into RStudio’s console it will hence return these three values as a vector unless you chose to overwrite it with different information.\nLet us look at this more closely with the id variable in the above data. Each person has a unique ID number from 1 to 4. We are going to list the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 as a sequence of elements into a vector using the combine function c() and then assign it as a vector object calling it id.\n\n# Create 'id' vector object \nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Type the vector object 'id' in console to see output or press the 'run' button\nid\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nNow, let us enter the information the same way for the remaining columns for name, height, weight and gender like we did for id:\n\n# Create 'name' vector object\nname &lt;- c(\"Kofi\", \"Harry\", \"Huijun\", \"Fatima\")\nname\n\n[1] \"Kofi\"   \"Harry\"  \"Huijun\" \"Fatima\"\n\n# Create 'height' (in meters) vector object\nheight &lt;- c(1.65, 1.77, 1.70, 1.68)\nheight\n\n[1] 1.65 1.77 1.70 1.68\n\n# Create 'weight' (in kg) vector object\nweight &lt;- c(64.2, 80.3, 58.7, 75.0)\nweight\n\n[1] 64.2 80.3 58.7 75.0\n\n# Create 'gender' vector object\ngender &lt;- c(\"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\")\ngender\n\n[1] \"M\" \"M\" \"F\" \"F\"\n\n\nNow, that we have the vector objects ready. Let us bring them together to create a proper dataset. This new object is called a Data frame. We need to list the vectors inside the data.frame() function. For example:\n\n# Create a dataset (data frame)\ndataset &lt;- data.frame(id, name, height, weight, gender)\n\n# Type the data frame object 'dataset' in console to print the output in console\ndataset\n\n  id   name height weight gender\n1  1   Kofi   1.65   64.2      M\n2  2  Harry   1.77   80.3      M\n3  3 Huijun   1.70   58.7      F\n4  4 Fatima   1.68   75.0      F\n\n\nYou can also see dataset in a data viewer, by using the View() function to see in a spreadsheet:\n\nView(dataset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe column ‘id’ is a numeric variable with integers. The second column ‘name’ is a text variable with strings. The third & fourth columns ‘height’ and ‘weight’ are examples of numeric variables with real numbers with continuous measures. The variable ‘gender’ is a text variable with strings – however, this type of variable is classed as a categorical variable as individuals were categorised as either ‘M’ and ‘F’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo access a variable by its name within a data frame, you will need to first type the name of the data frame followed by a $ (dollar sign), and then typing the variable’s name of interest. For instance, suppose you just want to see the height values in the Console viewer - you just type:\n\n# to access height - you need to type 'dataset$height'\ndataset$height\n\n[1] 1.65 1.77 1.70 1.68\n\n\nWe can use other columns or variables within our data frame to create another variable. This technique is essentially important when cleaning and managing data. From this dataset, it is possible to derive the body mass index bmi from height and weight using the formula:\n\n\n\\(BMI = weight/height^2\\)\n\n\nTo generate bmi into our data frame, we would need to access the height (m) and weight (kg) columns using the $ from the data frame its stored to, and apply the above formula as a code to generate the new bmi column:\n\n# Create 'bmi' in the data frame i.e.,'dataset' and calculate 'bmi'\n# using the $weight and $height\ndataset$bmi &lt;- dataset$weight/((dataset$height)^2)\n# View the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the new bmi variable inside\nView(dataset)\n\nYou can overwrite the height (m) column to change its units into centimeters by multiplying it to 100; equally, the weight (kg) column can be overwritten and converted from units of kilograms to grams by multiplying it to 1000.\n\n# using $height and *100 \ndataset$height &lt;- dataset$height*100\n# using $weight and *100\ndataset$weight &lt;- dataset$weight*1000\n# view updated dataset\ndataset\n\n  id   name height weight gender      bmi\n1  1   Kofi    165  64200      M 23.58127\n2  2  Harry    177  80300      M 25.63120\n3  3 Huijun    170  58700      F 20.31142\n4  4 Fatima    168  75000      F 26.57313\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell done! You have learnt the basics of coding in RStudio - next week, we will learn further coding etiquettes for managing datasets which includes:\n\nImporting & exporting spreadsheets with RStudio\nSetting up work directories\nRow and column manipulations\nMerging two data frames.\n\nYou can now save your script for future use by clicking on the save icon in the menu bar.",

    "text": "The R Console window (Panel 1) is where RStudio waits for you to tell it what to do. It displays the code you enter and the results of each command. You can type commands directly into this window for immediate execution.\nLet’s begin by using the Console as a basic calculator for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponents (^), and other calculations.\nClick inside the R Console window, type 19+8, and press the Enter key (↵) to see the result. Then try the following calculations by typing them into the Console:\n\n# Perform addition\n19+8\n\n# Perform subtraction\n20-89\n\n# Perform multiplication\n18*20\n\n# Perform division\n27/3\n\n# To number to a power e.g., 2 raise to the power of 8\n2^8\n\n# Perform complex sums\n(5*(170-3.405)/91)+1002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe text that follows a hash symbol # in the code chunk is a comment, not actual code. It explains what the line of code without the # is doing.\n\n\nIn addition to basic arithmetic operations, we can also use common mathematical functions such as exponentials and logarithms:\n\nexp() calculates the exponential\nlog() calculates the logarithm\n\nDo not worry about fully understanding these functions for now as you will likely use them later in Weeks 8 and 9 when transforming variables.\nTry the following by typing them into the R Console window:\n\n# use exp() to apply an exponential to a value\nexp(5) \n\n# use log() to transforrm a value on to a logarithm scale\nlog(3)",

    "text": "Let’s open an R Script file!\nNow that we are familiar with using the Console as a calculator, let’s build on this and learn one of the most important features in R: the Assignment Operator.\nThe arrow symbol &lt;- is called the Assignment Operator. You type it by pressing the less-than symbol &lt; followed by the hyphen -. It allows you to assign values to an object in R.\nObjects are stored quantities in RStudio’s environment. They can hold anything from numeric values to character strings. For example, to create a numeric object called x and assign it the value 3, type: x &lt;- 3. When you enter x in the Console and press Enter (↵), R will return the numeric value 3.\nSimilarly, to create a string object called y and assign it the text \"Hello!\", type: y &lt;- \"Hello!\" When you enter y in the Console, it will return the text value Hello!.\nNow, let’s create the objects a, b, c, and d and assign them numeric values. Perform the following by typing them into the R Console:\n\n# Create an object called 'a' and assign the value 17 to it\na &lt;- 17\n\n# Type the object 'a' in console as a command to return value 17\na\n\n# Create an object called 'b' and assign the value 10 to it\nb &lt;- 10\n\n# Type the object 'b' in console as a command to return value 10\nb\n\n# Create an object called 'c' and assign the value 9 to it\nc &lt;- 9\n\n# Type the object 'c' in console as a command to return value 9\nc\n\n# Create an object called 'd' and assign the value 8 to it\nd &lt;- 8\n\n# Type the object 'd' in console as a command to return value 8\nd\n\nNotice how the objects a, b, c and d and its value are listed and stored in RStudio’s environment panel. We can perform the following maths operations with these object values:\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(a + b + c + d)/5\n\n# type the following and return an answer\n(5*(a-c)/d)^2\n\nLet us create more objects but this time we will assign character string(s) to them. Please note that when typing a string of characters as data you will need to cover them with quotation marks \"...\". For example, say we want to create a string object called y and assign it with some text \"Hello!\". We do this by typing y &lt;- \"Hello!\".\nTry these examples of assigning the following character text to an object:\nLet’s create more objects, but this time we will assign character strings to them. When typing a string of characters as data, you must enclose them in quotation marks \"...\".\nFor example, to create a string object called y and assign it the text \"Hello!\", type: y &lt;- \"Hello!\"\nTry the following examples to assign character text to objects:\n\n# Create an object called 'e' and assign the character string \"RStudio\"\ne &lt;- \"RStudio\"\n\n# Type the object 'e' in the console as a command to return \"RStudio\"\ne\n\n# Create an object called 'f', assign character string \"Hello world\" \nf &lt;- \"Hello world\"\n\n# Type the object 'f' in the console as a command to return \"Hello world\"\nf\n\n# Create an object called 'g' and assign \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\ng &lt;- \"Blade Runner is amazing\"\n\n# Type the object 'g' in the console to return the result\ng",

    "text": "In programming, variables are used to store information, and each has a type determined by the kind of data it holds (e.g., integer, character, factor, logical). Assigning an integer makes the variable type “int.” A variable is simply a reserved memory location where values are stored.\nTo use R effectively, you need a solid understanding of its basic data types, data structures, and how to work with them.\nR has a range of data types. The most common ones are:\n\nnumeric (whole, real or decimal)\nlogical\ncharacter\nfactor\n\nBelow are some basic examples of data points that are classed as character, numeric, or integer values, etc.\n\ncharacter: “a”, “swc”\nnumeric: 2.0, 15.5\nlogical: TRUE, FALSE\nfactor: 2 levels “boy”, “girl” (text categories with assigned numbers as a label)\n\nYou can use the class function i.e., class() on any object to identify its data type. For example, using the class() function on existing objects we created early on (i.e., e and f) in section 1.4 tells us that its a character object.\n\ne &lt;- \"RStudio\"\nf &lt;- \"Hello world\"\n\n\nclass(f)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(e)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nAnother example, using the class() function on existing objects we created early on (i.e., a and b) in section 1.4 tells us that its a numeric object.\n\na &lt;- 17\nb &lt;- 10\n\n\nclass(a)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(b)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nWe are now familiar with using the console and assigning numeric and string to objects, and identifying their data type. Let’s learn who to enter data into RStudio and create our first data frame.",

    "text": "Here, we will learn some basics coding etiquettes creating a dataset from scratch using the two functions:\n\nc() combine function\ndata.frame(): data frame function\n\nAs you have already seen, RStudio is an object-oriented software package and so entering data is slightly different from the usual way of inputting information into a spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Here, you will need to enter the information as a Vector object before combining them into a Data Frame object.\nConsider this crude example of data containing the additional health information for 4 people. It contains the variable (or column) names id, name, height, weight and gender.\n\n\n\nid\nname\nheight\nweight\ngender\n\n\n\n\n1\nKofi\n1.65\n64.2\nM\n\n\n2\nHarry\n1.77\n80.3\nM\n\n\n3\nHuijun\n1.70\n58.7\nF\n\n\n4\nFatima\n1.68\n75.0\nF\n\n\n\nNow, when entering data to RStudio it is not like Microsoft Excel where we enter data into the cells of a spreadsheet. In RStudio, data is entered as a sequence of elements and listed inside an object called a vector.\nFor instance, if we have three age values of 12, 57 and 26 years, and we want to enter this in RStudio in that order, we need to use the combine function c() and combine these three elements into a vector object. Hence, the code will be c(12, 57, 26). We can assign this data by typing this code as age &lt;- c(12, 57, 26). Any time you type age into RStudio’s console it will hence return these three values as a vector unless you chose to overwrite it with different information.\nLet us look at this more closely with the id variable in the above data. Each person has a unique ID number from 1 to 4. We are going to list the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 as a sequence of elements into a vector using the combine function c() and then assign it as a vector object calling it id.\n\n# Create 'id' vector object \nid &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Type the vector object 'id' in console to see output or press the 'run' button\nid\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nNow, let us enter the information the same way for the remaining columns for name, height, weight and gender like we did for id:\n\n# Create 'name' vector object\nname &lt;- c(\"Kofi\", \"Harry\", \"Huijun\", \"Fatima\")\nname\n\n[1] \"Kofi\"   \"Harry\"  \"Huijun\" \"Fatima\"\n\n# Create 'height' (in meters) vector object\nheight &lt;- c(1.65, 1.77, 1.70, 1.68)\nheight\n\n[1] 1.65 1.77 1.70 1.68\n\n# Create 'weight' (in kg) vector object\nweight &lt;- c(64.2, 80.3, 58.7, 75.0)\nweight\n\n[1] 64.2 80.3 58.7 75.0\n\n# Create 'gender' vector object\ngender &lt;- c(\"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\")\ngender\n\n[1] \"M\" \"M\" \"F\" \"F\"\n\n\nNow, that we have the vector objects ready. Let us bring them together to create a proper dataset. This new object is called a Data frame. We need to list the vectors inside the data.frame() function. For example:\n\n# Create a dataset (data frame)\ndataset &lt;- data.frame(id, name, height, weight, gender)\n\n# Type the data frame object 'dataset' in console to print the output in console\ndataset\n\n  id   name height weight gender\n1  1   Kofi   1.65   64.2      M\n2  2  Harry   1.77   80.3      M\n3  3 Huijun   1.70   58.7      F\n4  4 Fatima   1.68   75.0      F\n\n\nYou can also see dataset in a data viewer, by using the View() function to see in a spreadsheet:\n\nView(dataset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe column ‘id’ is a numeric variable with integers. The second column ‘name’ is a text variable with strings. The third & fourth columns ‘height’ and ‘weight’ are examples of numeric variables with real numbers with continuous measures. The variable ‘gender’ is a text variable with strings – however, this type of variable is classed as a categorical variable as individuals were categorised as either ‘M’ and ‘F’.",

    "text": "To access a variable by its name within a data frame, you will need to first type the name of the data frame followed by a $ (dollar sign), and then typing the variable’s name of interest.

This technique is essentially important when cleaning and managing data. From this dataset, it is possible to derive the body mass index bmi from height and weight using the formula:\n\n\n\\(BMI = weight/height^2\\)\n\n\nTo generate bmi into our data frame, we would need to access the height (m) and weight (kg) columns using the $ from the data frame its stored to, and apply the above formula as a code to generate the new bmi column:\n\n# Create 'bmi' in the data frame i.e.,'dataset' and calculate 'bmi'\n# using the $weight and $height\ndataset$bmi &lt;- dataset$weight/((dataset$height)^2)\n# View the data frame ‘dataset’ and you will see the new bmi variable inside\nView(dataset)\n\nYou can overwrite the height (m) column to change its units into centimeters by multiplying it to 100; equally, the weight (kg) column can be overwritten and converted from units of kilograms to grams by multiplying it to 1000.\n\n# using $height and *100 \ndataset$height &lt;- dataset$height*100\n# using $weight and *100\ndataset$weight &lt;- dataset$weight*1000\n# view updated dataset\ndataset\n\n  id   name height weight gender      bmi\n1  1   Kofi    165  64200      M 23.58127\n2  2  Harry    177  80300      M 25.63120\n3  3 Huijun    170  58700      F 20.31142\n4  4 Fatima    168  75000      F 26.57313",
