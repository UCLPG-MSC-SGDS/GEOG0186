# Handling Data Structures in RStudio

## Learning objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Set your working directory on Mac and Windows
2. Import a .csv file into RStudio
3. Understand the structure of a data frame (rows and columns)
4. Filter data using both numeric and categorical variables
5. Combine multiple conditions with logical operators to perform further filtering of data
5. Export data back into a .csv file

These objectives combined with those from last week serve as a gateway to learning RStudio and building a strong foundation. Let us begin!

## Setting the Working Directory to Datasets

:::{.callout-warning}
Before we do anything - make sure to have downloaded the data set for this computer session by clicking [**[HERE]**](). There are three datasets: 

1. `Primary Schools in Ealing.csv`: This comma seperated file (CSV) contains the data needed to to follow today's tutorials. 
2. `Open Street Drains in Accra`: This folder contains images of stormwater drainage infrastructure in Accra. It will be needed in part one of **Task 1**. 
3. `Prevalence of Soil Transmitted Helminths in Africa.csv`: This dataset contains point locations for villages across sub-Saharan Africa. It will be needed in part two of **Task 1**.

**Instructions**
In your computer, do the following:

1. Create a new folder on your desktop page and rename the folder to **GEOG0186**
2. Next, create a new sub-folder within **GEOG0186** and rename it as **Week 2**. 
3. The downloaded data from the folder **Dataset for Week 2**, make sure to unzip and transfer **ALL** the datasets directly to the **Week 2** folder.
